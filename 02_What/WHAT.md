## What Makes _Pong_, _Pong_?
***

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)
> 
> Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
> The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. 
> They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. 
> Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. 
> The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; 
> points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.


When we look at _Pong_, we need to consider what makes _Pong_, _Pong_. Luckily there's not a lot going on.

Things we want to consider:
* Visuals
  * A paddle for each player. 
  * A ball.
  * A "net".
  * The score of each player.
* Systems
  * Scoring 
  * Player movement
  * Player and ball collision
  * Collisions between the ball and screen boundary.
  * Possible AI for the second player

Let's start of with an easy change that instantly gives us a retro feel.

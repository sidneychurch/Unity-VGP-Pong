* Under project settings, give your project an appropriate name. I chose "PongRemake".

* Scroll down and check "Connect to Unity Cloud" and "Use Unity Version Control".
    * The repository name will be autofilled in with your project name.

* Click Create Project

Now just wait a bit for Unity to compile and create the needed resources for your new project.
